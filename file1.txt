This has been my first ever project in c lang.
I have not quite undertaken it seriously but still dabbled along the way and somehow completed it.
Although it has been quite a pleasureable experience being able to undertake a project with my group.
They co-operated pretty well and thus were able to provide end-to-end support for the project.
Overall it felt somewhat nice being able to create something on our own.
